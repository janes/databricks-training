    "\n",
    "The opposite of dynamic typing is static typing. Static type checks are performed without running the program. In most statically typed languages, for instance C and Java, this is done as your program is compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "With static typing, variables generally are not allowed to change types, although mechanisms for casting a variable to a different type may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will always remain a dynamically typed language. However, PEP 484 introduced type hints, which make it possible to also do static type checking of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike how types work in most other statically typed languages, type hints by themselves don’t cause Python to enforce types. As the name says, type hints just suggest types. There are other tools, which you’ll see later, that perform static type checking using type hints."

    "### Advantages of Type Checking\n",

    "\n",
    "Type hints help document your code. Traditionally, you would use docstrings if you wanted to document the expected types of a function’s arguments. This works, but as there is no standard for docstrings (despite PEP 257 they can’t be easily used for automatic checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints improve IDEs and linters. They make it much easier to statically reason about your code. This in turn allows IDEs to offer better code completion and similar features. With the type annotation, PyCharm knows that text is a string, and can give specific suggestions based on this:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints help you build and maintain a cleaner architecture. The act of writing type hints forces you to think about the types in your program. While the dynamic nature of Python is one of its great assets, being conscious about relying on duck typing, overloaded methods, or multiple return types is a good thing."
